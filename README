This is a fork of gdb that is used for Rust.

Ordinarily any patch going committed here should first go upstream.
You can find upstream contribution instructions here:

    https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ContributionChecklist

There are a few local patches that should not be upstreamed.

To update gdb, make a new branch based on the corresponding gdb
release branch.  Then cherry-pick the local changes onto the new
branch.  Finally, after pushing the new branch, send a PR to the rust
project to update the gdb submodule.
